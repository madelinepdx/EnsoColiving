# Enso Co-living

Enso Co-living is a mobile application tailored specifically for residents of Enso Co-living spaces, offering a digital platform to manage various aspects of co-living experiences. Developed with Bubble.io, this app integrates seamlessly with Monday.com (CRM) to automate workflows and enhance user interactions.

## Key Features

- **Profile Management**: Residents can view and update their personal information, such as contact details and contractual documents. Integration with Monday.com ensures real-time data accuracy.
- **Maintenance Requests**: Submit incident request form for all housing issues (sent to Monday.com).
- **Event Calendar**: Participate in community events; ability to view, sign up, and submit events.
- **Resident Handbook**: Quick access to community rules and guidelines.
- **Dynamic Contact Options**: Contact management across various departments with options adapted to selected city locations.
### Automated User Management
- **Webhook Integration Challenges**: While the system is designed to utilize webhooks from Monday.com to manage user access based on their current tenant status, there were challenges in retrieving and processing the webhook data effectively within Bubble.io. The webhook setup was successful on Monday.comâ€™s end, but the data retrieval and subsequent handling on Bubble.io's backend did not perform as expected. This area is a potential opportunity for further development and optimization.

- **Automated User Management**: Utilizes webhooks from Monday.com to manage user access based on their current tenant status.

## Technologies Used

- **Bubble.io**: Primary development platform for creating the frontend and backend of the app.
- **Monday.com**: Integration for CRM and automated workflows via webhooks, facilitating dynamic user and content management.
- **APIs**: Custom APIs for real-time data retrieval and management, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.
